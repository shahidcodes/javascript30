      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      // one way
      let players1 = Array.from(players);
      players1[0] = "tanweer";
      console.log(players, players1);

      players3[0] = "shahid";
      console.log({ players1, players3 });
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      let players4 = ["sameer", ...players3];
      console.log({ players4 });
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };
      // and think we make a copy:
      const person2 = person;
      person2.name = "Sameer";
      console.log(person);
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const person3 = Object.assign({}, person);
      person3.name = "Kabe";
      console.log({ person3, person });
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
